This is a simple image gallery slider created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to scroll through images with "Previous" and "Next" buttons for smooth navigation.

- 🎨 Displays a series of images in a responsive slider
- 🖱️ Users can navigate between images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons
- ⚙️ Smooth transition effect between slides
- 📱 Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

### Technologies Used:
<div>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white" alt="HTML5 Badge"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white" alt="CSS3 Badge"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=white" alt="JavaScript Badge"/>
</div>

### How It Works:
1. The images are placed inside a container using `flexbox`.
2. The "Previous" and "Next" buttons control the current image index.
3. JavaScript handles the slide transitions by updating the `translateX` property to shift images horizontally.
